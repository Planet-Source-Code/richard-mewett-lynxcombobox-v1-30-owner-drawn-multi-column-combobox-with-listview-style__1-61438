### Description

- Updated in response to feedback 11 Nov 06 -

Owner-drawn ComboBox that provides multiple columns in a ListView (in Report View) style display. Features include Item CheckBoxes, Item Images, dynamic Column Sorting/Resizing, Item Formatting (ForeColor, FontBold etc), datatype aware sorts, custom sorts and auto-scrolling (when mouse dragged out of control). Supports native XP Themes &amp; emulation of XP/Office XP Themes. Feedback welcome (votes appreciated!) Credits in source for PSC authors who have helped make this possible.

NOTE: This control has partial Unicode Support (Editable Mode does not support Unicode Data Entry due to VB TextBox)

UPDATE: This Control was formerly called ComboView - renamed for consistency with my other controls.
